    description: '把自己當成第九個個案九…代表著「對話對畫」將開始永久的成為我一生的熱愛在真正的與自己對話對畫之後然而與自己似乎不易用文字表達對了什麼話…這也許很多人無法相信，如此刮燥的我…千頭百緒，就像這畫一般，看似如同雜亂的夢境毫不遲疑的拿起大紅，刷刷刷的在畫布正中央灑下接下來的部份，我必須用英文說明…The night before i started drawing, i had a dream that my father died. lately i 've had dreams that people who are close to me died, and I woke up feeling confused and sad. So i somehow thought i 'd better try to connect this with my drawing...i had no idea what i was thinking or feeling, then suddenly a rush of sadness came to me, and i started to cry. But it wasn't because of the dream. ..or maybe it was...actually in the middle of the drawing, i saw an image of a man holding a girl. Then i remembered that someone had told me recently that my father loved me very much, and perhaps in his heart, i haven't really grown up.I hardly ever feel that he loves me, although i know he does. And i know he loves me in his ways. I accept it all now. Whatever it is...it just is. No need to fight or judge or feel guilty about it. It's just weird to hear it when someone tells me how much he loves me.  It's like, sure, i believe it. but at the same time....i don't know how to feel about this belief.i saw the image there, a man with a bit belly holding a girl-like person. It wasn't clear, and i didn't know how to fix that image. So i repainted it. Now the image is gone.I didn't cry for long. Maybe it's because i found it a bit silly.My hand then keeps moving all over it. Somehow i just wanted to use really heavy colors, but it got out of balance  many times. I hate it when i feel it's out of balance.  All the blue and red circles seem to mean they're the fruits of my work. They're my creations. They keep coming out of me, my head, my heart, my soul. They keep growing and growing. And there comes more and more circles and seeds in them. I'm not totally satisfied with the outcome.. And i wonder who in the world will think this is art? And then started to question and doubt myself again just  as i did every time in the middle of and after all the works that i'd done.But it really doesn't matter. I've never asked to be understood, and neither have my works. There's more connection to be done.More fruits to be born.More creations to be created.所以如果你想來成為我的第十位…第十一位…請與我聯絡。'
