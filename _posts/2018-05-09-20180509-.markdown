story: "胡作霏為 Fei Fei Art updated their status."  message: "20180509  Mother   --------------------------------------  About 8 years ago, a man who said would love me for a long time left me without leaving me a reason. When i started to believe he was the one,  he said to me, " You're not the woman who i'll spend the rest of my life with."      Though it was an answer from above, it still hurt me a lot.     I felt so bad...so bad that i even called my mom, crying. Normally i wouldn't tell her if i get hurt. Normally, I deal with life, and tell them the good news later.      But when you're just a little kid and you get bullied, you'd tell your mommy and daddy. They listen to you, comfort you, and you feel healed.      I was feeling so sad that i was like a bullied kid. Called mom  on the street,crying, telling her i needed to see her right away. I could feel how shocked and worried she was on the other side of the phone. We met 15 minutes later in a coffee shop. I knew she probably came running to meet me.    " We broke up." I said.  Strangely enough, just after i said that and the rest of the story, it felt like i was telling someone else' story. She looked so relieved hearing what i said, " So it's about that. Gosh..i thought it was something really bad...."     She didn't blame me, saying," see, i told you ..." or " why don't you..." or..." sigh....i knew it..." She just said, " It's OK.".  Somehow it's so important to hear her saying, " It's OK".    That made me realize how small my problem was, and how important i was to her.     I was healed  right then right there. Motherly love heals. Works thousand times better than anything else. I felt i wasn't alone. I felt i was still loved....unconditionally.     It's ok when someone just stops loving you. It's OK when they love you conditionally because i know there's one person in the world who will always love me no matter what.     A few days later, i saw a cute little plant placed in my rental home.  " Did you see that plant? " She told me on the phone. " I put it there to remind  you that you're still loved; when you see it, remember that."    I will always remember that. The plant is always there in my heart. When i'm alone, not being understood, or hurt, i know i'm still loved by her.     This painting is for her, the woman who loves me the most.  I was feeling so deeply connected with her love while painting.  Later i seem to see a dancing figure in the middle of it--- elegant, loving, kind, and happy，ready to give her love.  I think that's her. That's every mother  in the world.     I love you, Mother.  媽媽我愛你。母親節快樂   <3 <3 <3"

Mother

About 8 years ago, a man who said would love me for a long time left me without leaving me a reason. When i started to believe he was the one,  he said to me, " You're not the woman who i'll spend the rest of my life with."   
  
 Though it was an answer from above, it still hurt me a lot.   
  
I felt so bad...so bad that i even called my mom, crying. Normally i wouldn't tell her if i get hurt. Normally, I deal with life, and tell them the good news later.
