    description: '2016年5月我再次回到以往的繪畫模式---設定好想連結的主題，然後放手去畫。這次我選擇了「出生」。I tried to go back to my original painting mode this time-- connecting with the subject i choose, and let my hand go and paint. This time, the subject was, " the birth"開始作畫前我靜心了片刻。我盼望創作除了「表達自己」之外，還能有更深一層的目的--尋找自身生命的答案，甚至，也許有一天，能用這樣的經驗來幫助其他的人。Before i started, i meditated for a while. "Expressing the self" is always an important purpose of painting, but i hope there's more than that. I hope it's a chance for me to find a deeper meaning of or answer to life, and maybe one day, I can use these experiences to help others.真正的療癒不在於用畫畫來發洩或舒壓，而是在於你與它的對話和投入，和你所設定的主題連結之後得到的一個啟示。The true healing when painting doesn't lie on relieving your stress or making yourself feel relaxed. It only happens when you truly converse and connect with it, which leads you to an inspiration or enlightenment.  靜心之後，我開始連結這個主題。所謂的連結，其實就是放開自己的小我，敞開自己，讓這個主題進入大我。然後，其它的，就是看看，我的心到底要和我說什麼。So, after the meditation, i started connecting with this subject. The so-called " connect", means i let go of the ego self, and open the big, unlimited self to welcome the subject in. Then i wait for the rest to happen.畫著畫著，忽然無意間，在畫面的下方自然的畫出一個類似尚未成型的胎兒。就在感到驚訝之餘，我打開電腦，第一個看到的他人上傳的影片，就是一個精子到胎兒的過程。影片中的未成型胎兒，就和我無意識畫出來的時候一樣! 我不知道代表著什麼，而我也不去想。Not long after i started, an image that looked like a fetus at the bottom part was formed without my intention. I was amused by it. Just when i took a break and checked out my FB, the first thing posted right in front of me was a short video about how a sperm turned into an infant. The fetus looked exactly like the one i painted. I didn't know what that meant, and i tried not to think about it.當畫面的右上方幾乎占滿了畫面，我放在中間的位子，不知道應該如何繼續畫下去，只感覺到中間出現在彎彎曲曲的線條，在等待我找到它的方向。就在這時，我又在網路上不經意的看到一個小小的「人類基音圖」，於是這個空間的答案出現了，它是那麼剛好的被放在那個位子。然後，我繼續連結…連結…然後，類似精子的東西出現了。這些，都不是在我的預料之下，就是這樣自然的產生了。When the right side part of the painting was almost fully occupied with colors and shapes, i got stuck with the middle space. Something seemed to be waiting for me with those curvy lines. Just at this time,  another picture of a gene map popped out from my page and there i found the answer for the middle space. It was so right to be placed there as if it was waiting for me to do that. Then I kept connecting.......and things like ' germs' appeared.....All this happened without my planning. They just showed up.最後剩下左邊的空白。作畫的一開始，我在畫面上到處上色，那時在左邊畫了兩個半圓型。現在，這個部份我不知該如何完成它。但我並不想破壞這兩個半圓。因為我感覺到，這裡有一個東西在等我去完成它，當初所畫的半圓一定是有目的的。我卡住了幾天，終於，某個聲音告訴我，那個空白在等待我的，是一個懷孕的母親的側影。Finally it came to the left side space. In the beginning, i added some colors here and there on the canvas, and i drew 2 semicircles at the left side area. Now, i didn't want to erase them cos i had a strong feeling that they had a meaning and they were waiting for me to finish them. Again, i was stuck for a few days, during which i didn't do much but waiting. Then, a voice told me what was waiting for my brush was a silhouette of a pregnant woman.一個接著一個的驚喜，似乎我真正和這個主題連結上了。這個胎兒，最後和這個母體面對面，但是胎兒卻比母體還要大。基因在他們的中間，決定了什麼命運呢? 而胎兒被一層黑色物質困住，似乎，有某個負面意念，在和它拉扯。雖然如此，它頭部以上卻是被光包圍，它是帶著光而來，但一生註定有許多挑戰。A surprise after another. I seemed to be really connecting with this. This fetus is now face to face with the woman, but it's bigger than she is. The gene map is right between them. What destiny is ahead of them? The fetus seems to be stuck with some kind of dark energy ---for me it represents negative thoughts mind, and it's dragging and pulling the fetus. However, its head is surrounded by light. It's coming with light but challenges are  there to be faced.與它連結之後，一度莫名的悲傷。一邊哭泣一邊畫。但我知道這會是一最深層的療癒。我將這個畫的目的設定好了; 當我完成它之後，我在胎兒時期所接收到的所有負面能量，都將隨之消散。During the process, there was a time when i couldn't help but cry ..without knowing why. But i knew it was going to be a deep healing journey. I had set up the goal of this one; The moment i have finished this work, all the negative energy that the fetus  I had received in its womb would  vanish.生命像是場無止無盡的輪迴，一次又一次的開始與結束，看似一場夢的生命，也許只要是來喚醒我們的本源，在此時此刻了悟，在此時此刻超脫俗世的枷鎖。Life is like an endless reincarnation. All these meaningless beginnings and endings seem to be just a dream. But maybe the only purpose of it is to awaken us so that we can find the true Self, get enlightened right here and now, and transcend the mundane world.這次的創作過程，有感動，有驚喜，有淚水，也許我還沒找到所有的答案，但我想至少我已經帶著感恩啟程。The process of creating " the birth" brought me some surprises and tears, yet , i may have not found all the answers, but i'm sure i have started the journey with gratitude.'

2016年5月  
  
我再次回到以往的繪畫模式---設定好想連結的主題，然後放手去畫。這次我選擇了「出生」。  
I tried to go back to my original painting mode this time-- connecting with the subject i choose, and let my hand go and paint. This time, the subject was, " the birth"  
  
開始作畫前我靜心了片刻。我盼望創作除了「表達自己」之外，還能有更深一層的目的--尋找自身生命的答案，甚至，也許有一天，能用這樣的經驗來幫助其他的人。  
Before i started, i meditated for a while. "Expressing the self" is always an important purpose of painting, but i hope there's more than that. I hope it's a chance for me to find a deeper meaning of or answer to life, and maybe one day, I can use these experiences to help others.  
  
真正的療癒不在於用畫畫來發洩或舒壓，而是在於你與它的對話和投入，和你所設定的主題連結之後得到的一個啟示。  
The true healing when painting doesn't lie on relieving your stress or making yourself feel relaxed. It only happens when you truly converse and connect with it, which leads you to an inspiration or enlightenment.    
  
靜心之後，我開始連結這個主題。所謂的連結，其實就是放開自己的小我，敞開自己，讓這個主題進入大我。然後，其它的，就是看看，我的心到底要和我說什麼。  
So, after the meditation, i started connecting with this subject. The so-called " connect", means i let go of the ego self, and open the big, unlimited self to welcome the subject in. Then i wait for the rest to happen.

When the right side part of the painting was almost fully occupied with colors and shapes, i got stuck with the middle space. Something seemed to be waiting for me with those curvy lines. Just at this time,  another picture of a gene map popped out from my page and there i found the answer for the middle space. It was so right to be placed there as if it was waiting for me to do that. Then I kept connecting.......and things like ' germs' appeared.....All this happened without my planning. They just showed up.  
  
最後剩下左邊的空白。作畫的一開始，我在畫面上到處上色，那時在左邊畫了兩個半圓型。現在，這個部份我不知該如何完成它。但我並不想破壞這兩個半圓。因為我感覺到，這裡有一個東西在等我去完成它，當初所畫的半圓一定是有目的的。我卡住了幾天，終於，某個聲音告訴我，那個空白在等待我的，是一個懷孕的母親的側影。

一個接著一個的驚喜，似乎我真正和這個主題連結上了。這個胎兒，最後和這個母體面對面，但是胎兒卻比母體還要大。基因在他們的中間，決定了什麼命運呢? 而胎兒被一層黑色物質困住，似乎，有某個負面意念，在和它拉扯。雖然如此，它頭部以上卻是被光包圍，它是帶著光而來，但一生註定有許多挑戰。  
A surprise after another. I seemed to be really connecting with this. This fetus is now face to face with the woman, but it's bigger than she is. The gene map is right between them. What destiny is ahead of them? The fetus seems to be stuck with some kind of dark energy ---for me it represents negative thoughts/ mind, and it's dragging and pulling the fetus. However, its head is surrounded by light. It's coming with light but challenges are  there to be faced.  
  
與它連結之後，一度莫名的悲傷。一邊哭泣一邊畫。但我知道這會是一最深層的療癒。我將這個畫的目的設定好了: 當我完成它之後，我在胎兒時期所接收到的所有負面能量，都將隨之消散。  
During the process, there was a time when i couldn't help but cry ..without knowing why. But i knew it was going to be a deep healing journey. I had set up the goal of this one: The moment i have finished this work, all the negative energy that the fetus ( I) had received in its womb would  vanish.  
  
生命像是場無止無盡的輪迴，一次又一次的開始與結束，看似一場夢的生命，也許只要是來喚醒我們的本源，在此時此刻了悟，在此時此刻超脫俗世的枷鎖。  
Life is like an endless reincarnation. All these meaningless beginnings and endings seem to be just a dream. But maybe the only purpose of it is to awaken us so that we can find the true Self, get enlightened right here and now, and transcend the mundane world.  
  
這次的創作過程，有感動，有驚喜，有淚水，也許我還沒找到所有的答案，但我想至少我已經帶著感恩啟程。  
The process of creating " the birth" brought me some surprises and tears, yet , i may have not found all the answers, but i'm sure i have started the journey with gratitude.
