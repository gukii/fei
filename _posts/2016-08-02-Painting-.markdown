message: 'Painting for me is not just about creating an image full of lines, shapes and colors. It's more about all the moments of focusing on the subject that i want to connect to. It's about being mindful on what I do, how to breathe, how my eyes see, and how my heart feels.  I truly believe that if you put heart and soul to it, it'll be born with positive energy, and the viewers will also feel it.     It's also like cooking. Making a dish is not simply putting all the ingredients together. It's also not so much about skills and talents. They say your grandma's cookies always taste better. When the cooker puts love and care into the meal, the meal's energy becomes positive, which will benefit those who eat it. However, most people's senses have been too dull to feel the subtleties. We all just want to please our eyes with beauty, and satisfy our stomach with " food". We all live with dull senses.     There's always something more, something deeper, something realer, something purer.  It's a waste of life if at the end, all we have experienced was only on the surface.    This series I'm working on is a new project that I want to experiment.  What will come out if ...when i paint, i only focus on one single good thought?      The " Ho'oponopono healing treatment" uses 4 mantras to ' heal'-- " I'm sorry." " please forgive me." " thank you." and " I love you."  So the first part of this series, i am using these 4 mantras to see where my hands will lead me to.     Since i started this project, I've been feeling more excited than before because it's a chance that I create for myself to meditate on good thoughts, which help me calm my uncontrollable minds that sometimes make myself crazy.    I just finished " Thank you", and i do feel more thankful than ever. I look forward to creating the next one, " I love you."'
