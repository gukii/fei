### My Process

Creating something new out of broken surroundings. Cracked tiles. Broken floor boards. Cracks in the wall. We have a lot of earthquakes on the island. For me these imperfections are the start of silhouetts, outlines of things to come that slowly step into this world, as painting progresses.

Some lines, some paintings are without sense at the outset. Sometimes it takes time and I put paintings away. Later at some point, when the feeling is right, the same lines start telling a story, more and more capture what is on my deep mind. At some point it is hard to say what controls the flow. The lines. The thoughts. The flow. Often I m surprised by the outcome as well.

Generally I like the idea of starting from a broken out-set. Where others might see imperfection, even a need to repair, I see a way forward. All it requires is a shift in perspective and thinking and a willingness to create and experiment. 

There are a number of paintings that cover a similar topic or were created using a process specific to that series:


### Cracked Wall Series

My paitings are reflections on the past, people and abstract patterns surrounding myself such as the cracked wall tiles in the bathroom. 


### Healing Canvas Series

Painting to heal. Issues of the past brought to canvas. These are not easy and light paintings. Hard work pays off in one way or another..


### Talking Canvas Series

A 1-2 hour talk with a person. Mostly the person talks while I paint my impressions of the preson and the things being said. Nobody knows where the talk will go to, or what image it will create. As trust builds up more difficult topics and memories are reached. Similar to the cracks in the wall, these talks reveal the cracks in people's personalities and lifes. The gradually developing painting is a new perspecitve, a constructive angle on matter coming from the past. 

It can be refreshing, revealing, surprising or just an experience to see what kind of painting connects all these dots. As always with abstract painting, interpretation of paintings is differrent from person to person.


Mostly this is done with people I don't really know.
