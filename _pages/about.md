### My Process

Creating something new out of broken surroundings. Cracked tiles. Broken floor boards. Cracks in the wall. We have a lot of earthquakes on the island. For me these imperfections are the start of silhouetts, outlines of things to come that slowly step into this world, as painting progresses.

Some lines, some paintings are without sense at the outset. Sometimes it takes time and I put paintings away. Later at some point, when the feeling is right, the same lines start telling a story, more and more capture what is on my deep mind. At some point it is hard to say what controls the flow. The lines. The thoughts. The flow. Often I m surprised by the outcome as well.

Generally I like the idea of starting from a broken out-set. Where others might see imperfection, even a need to repair, I see a way forward. All it requires is a shift in perspective and thinking and a willingness to create and experiment. 

Reflections on my past, people and abstract patterns surrounding myself such as the cracked wall tiles in the bathroom. 


### Cracked Wall Series

Abstract paintings and pictures that want to come into this world. Recently I started painting reflections of strangers within the talking canvas series.
